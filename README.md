# Rayhunter for TP-Link M7350 V4

![Tests](https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter/actions/workflows/check-and-test.yml/badge.svg)

Rayhunter is an IMSI Catcher Catcher originally developed for the Orbic mobile hotspot (US market) and now ported to the TP-Link M7350 mobile hotspot (available worldwide).

**THIS CODE IS PROOF OF CONCEPT, IS BEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON IN HIGH RISK SITUATIONS**

## The Hardware

TP-Link M7350 mobile hotspot has several hardware revisions. You can check your version on a sticker behind the battery. Rayhunter has been tested and confirmed working on multiple versions of the TP-Link M7350.

## Installing Rayhunter

You can install Rayhunter easily by downloading and running the installation script.

### Quick Setup

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases Page](PhucHauDeveloper/rayhunter-tplink-m7350-v4/releases).
2. Extract the archive.
3. Open the extracted folder.
4. Run the `install.cmd` (Windows).
5. Follow the on-screen instructions.

After installation, the device will reboot and launch Rayhunter automatically. No manual telnet setup or firmware downgrades are required.

You can now access Rayhunter's Web UI at:

* `http://192.168.0.1:8080`

### ðŸš€ What's New in This Fork

This customized fork brings several usability and performance improvements over the original Rayhunter version:

    âœ… Web UI Integrated Directly into the TP-Link Admin Page
    You can access Rayhunter controls directly from the TP-Link web interface at http://192.168.0.1, no separate port or web UI required.

    âœ… Physical Button to Toggle Rayhunter
    Press and hold the top button on your TP-Link M7350 for 3 seconds to quickly enable or disable Rayhunter without needing a web or shell interface.

    âœ… Live Status Indicator on LCD Screen
    After the carrier name, if you see a #: symbol, Rayhunter is active. If this symbol is missing, Rayhunter is inactive.

    âœ… SSH Enabled, Telnet Disabled After Installation
    For better security, SSH is enabled by default for remote access, while Telnet is automatically disabled once the installation is complete.

    âœ… Built-in TTL Modification Tool (ttlset)
    This fork includes ttlset, allowing you to modify TTL values easilyâ€”useful for bypassing carrier tethering detection.

ðŸ“Œ These enhancements are designed to improve user experience and security while keeping installation simple and accessible.
## Usage

Once installed, Rayhunter will run automatically. It serves a web UI that provides basic controls, such as:

* Starting/stopping recordings
* Downloading captures
* Viewing heuristic analyses of captures

You can access the UI in one of two ways:

1. **Over WiFi**: Connect your phone/laptop to the TP-Link M7350 WiFi network and visit `http://192.168.0.1:8080`
2. **Over USB**: Connect the device via USB and visit the same address.

**Note:** If you are using VPN, you may not be able to access the UI.

If Rayhunter detects something, it will highlight it in the UI with a red line and logs:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need an active SIM card?

**Optional.** Some functionality may require a SIM card, but not necessarily an active one. You are encouraged to test with or without and share findings with the Rayhunter team.

### What if Rayhunter detects something?

You may consider turning off your phone or switching to airplane mode if suspicious activity is detected. Please share your data with [EFF](mailto:info@eff.org) (securely, if needed).

### Does Rayhunter work outside the US/Europe?

Yes. TP-Link M7350 is compatible with many LTE bands in Europe and Asia, and should work in most parts of Africa and South America.
